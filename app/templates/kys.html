        <p><strong>About the Karma Yoga Scholars (KYS) Program</strong></p>
        <br>
        Karma Yoga is one of the four pathways to reach salvation as recognized in the Bhagavad Gita. It is a pathway of selfless service in which one performs service for others without expecting anything in return. Through engaging in practical and theoretical study of karma yoga, KYS participants grow to appreciate the value of selfless service: 
        <br><br>
        <li>Education: Learning, discussing, and debating the philosophy behind Karma Yoga</li>
        <li>Service: Engaging in selfless service (to the camp), such as washing dishes, setting up dishes for meals, cleaning and maintaining the India Community Center</li>
        <li>Leadership: Planning and executing some camp events such as brother-sister day, twin day, and the dance party</li><br>
        Some groups have even volunteered in the greater Rochester community to help at the American Red Cross, The Ronald McDonald House, CP Rochester or Foodlink to name a few.
