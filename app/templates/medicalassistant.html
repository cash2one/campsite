        <p><strong>About the Medical Assistant Position</strong><br></p>
        <p>The Medical Assistant position is a great opportunity for an 18+ year old interested in pursuing a career in medicine. The Medical Assistant reports directly to the board and to the Doctor on call. The main responsibility of the medical assistant is to assist the Doctor. At the start of the camp, the Medical Assistant will consolidate the list of camper allergies and organize all medications within the infirmary (i.e. label medications by camper name and time of intake). During camp the Medical Assistant will keep the infirmary organized, take care of minor medical issues (i.e. scrapes or bruises), ensure regularly schedule medications are being taken, ensure any campers with food allergies are alerted prior to meals, etc.
