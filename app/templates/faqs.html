        <p>Please <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='pdf/TypicalCampDay.pdf') }}">click here</a> for what a typical camp day looks like. It is quite busy!</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Can I see this year’s camp schedule?</h3>
        <p>The camp schedule will be made available closer to the start of camp.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What should my child pack for camp?</h3>
        <p>Please <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='pdf/HHSCPackingList.pdf') }}">click here</a> to view camp packing list. We encourage you to initial all clothing using a sharpie. Laundry is done approximately 1 week into camp. Campers pair off with another camper and put all their darks in one bag and all their whites in the other bag. Counselors then take care of washing the clothes.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>When should we arrive to drop off our child? When should we come to pick them up?</h3>
        <p>Please see table on camp <a href="{{ url_for('information') }}">information page </a>
        <br>
        If you child is traveling by train/bus/plane then please try to schedule such that he/she arrives to the Rochester bus/train station or airport between 9:30 and 11:30 am and have departures between 10:00 – 4:30 pm.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>If my child is flying or taking a train/bus, will HHSC handle transportation to and from the camp facility?</h3>
        <p>Yes we do provide transportation between the camp grounds and the airport/bus station/train station for a $25 fee each way.  You may send us a check in advance or provide your kids with cash when they travel. Please note you are responsible for informing camp that your child needs transportation. You will receive an email with a survey link where the information can be provided.</p>

        <h3>My child is allergic to certain foods or has dietary restrictions (i.e. Vegan). Will the HHSC meals accommodate my child?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we have add campers with all sorts of dietary restrictions – vegan, nut allergies, no eggs, etc.<br>
        All meals are vegetarian. We do not use or serve any food with nuts due to the number of campers with nut allergies. Regardless, please inform us of all dietary restrictions when registering your child!<br>
        Please do not send any food with your child. Food in the cabins leads to bug infestations and counselors are instructed to confiscate any food from the campers. If there is a medical reason then please explain in the medical form and our medical staff will attend to the matter.
        </p>

        <h3>What happens if a medical emergency arises for my child during camp?</h3>
        <p>There is a licensed physician on the camp grounds 24/7. Please make sure your child’s medical form (in the registration) is up-to-date or you risk your child’s safety.<br>
        All counselors are trained in First Aid and will alert the physician in the case of an emergency. The physician will determine if the camper needs to be taken to the hospital.
        </p>

        <h3>As a local parent, can I visit my child during camp?</h3>
        <p>You may attend and observe any of the evening programs that begin around 7.30 pm and run till 9 pm. <br>
        Otherwise, you are not permitted to join in any other camp activities or go to the cabin grounds as it takes away from the camper experience and causes campers to get distracted. No one is allowed on the cabin grounds. <br>
        You are welcome and encouraged to come volunteer in the kitchen to help with meal preparation and serving. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Will I be able to call my child during camp?</h3>
        <p>We have a strict NO-PHONE policy at camp. Campers are not allowed to keep any electronics with them during camp and we do not receive phone calls. However, we have a set of phones that campers can use to call home if they so please. Note: We CANNOT force the campers to call home and as they get busy with camp, many of them will forget to or not want to call home.<br>
        In the case of a family emergency that requires you to get in contact with your child, please contact the camp president, Dr. Kamath, at 585-749-0512 or e-mail him at ckamath1@rochester.rr.com<br>
        While it is old fashioned, we encourage campers and parents to send written mail. Campers really enjoy receiving mail and counselors and staff enjoy teaching campers how to send mail. 
        </p>

        <h3>What is the best way to keep in touch with my child during camp?</h3>
        <p>The best way to stay in touch with your child is via written mail. While it is old fashioned, we encourage campers and parents to send written mail. Campers really enjoy receiving mail and counselors and staff enjoy teaching campers how to send mail. <br>
        Since we have a strict NO-PHONE policy, do not receive calls, and, while we provide phones for campers to call you, we cannot make them call you, written mail is the best way to communicate. <br>
        In the case of a family emergency that requires you to get in contact with your child, please contact the camp president, Dr. Kamath, at 585-749-0512 or e-mail him at ckamath1@rochester.rr.com
        </p>

        <h3>Can I send my child a care package?</h3>
        <p>Please do not send your child a care package unless you are sending something for the entire camp. If you want to send food, please make sure there is enough so everyone at camp gets a piece. Otherwise, the food will be confiscated. <br>
        If there is a family emergency, how do I get my camper out of camp?
        In the case of a family emergency that requires you to get in contact with your child, please contact the camp president, Dr. Kamath, at 585-749-0512 or e-mail him at ckamath1@rochester.rr.com
        </p>

        <h3>Will someone do my child’s laundry? Or can I come and pick-up my child’s laundry?</h3>
        <p>You are NOT permitted to enter the cabin grounds and do your child’s laundry. <br>
        Laundry is done approximately 1 week into camp. Campers pair off with another camper and put all their darks in one bag and all their whites in the other bag. Counselors then take care of washing and drying the clothes. It is important that all clothes are labeled using a sharpie to avoid mixing of clothes with the campers laundry buddy.
        </p>

        <h3>My child is between the ages of 13-15. Is this camp good for older campers?</h3>
        <p>In many years we have had a majority of the campers within the 13-15 age group. This age group really looks up to the counselors and are treated with more respect and responsibility by the counselors and staff. <br>
        In the evenings, the 13-15 year olds engage in group sharing where they discuss more mature topics revolving around growing up a Hindu and/or Indian in America. The one rule of group sharing is that whatever is said within group sharing stays within group sharing. 
        If your child is a returning camper between the ages of 13-15 then we encourage him/her to apply for Karma Yoga Scholars (KYS).
        </p>

        <h3>My child’s birthday occurs during camp. Can we send something for him/her or do something special?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we will send an email to parents of all campers with birthdays during camp. We ask that you donate $150 to pay for cake for the entire camp. Cake becomes the snack for that day and the campers will all sing Happy Birthday to your child. <br>
        What if my child has another program, occasion, or travel plans that conflicts with part of camp? Can we take him / her out for that period, come to camp late, or leave camp early?<br>
        We strongly encourage against this. Campers bond very closely with their fellow campers and counselors and missing camp events really takes away from this. This causes inconveniences to the counselors and staff running the camp who are keeping track of every camper, create and plan activities based on the total camper count, etc. They have to make accommodations for campers arriving late, leaving early or missing parts of camp, which takes time away from the other campers. <br>We request that if there is a conflict and your child cannot fully attend either session then please apply next year.  If you do decide to take your child out during the camp session without first discussing with the camp board and staff, then we may penalize you and/or not allow your child to return in future years.
